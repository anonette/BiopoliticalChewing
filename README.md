# Biopolitical Chewing
We explore chewing as means of biopolitical control in food interaction. 
Join our effort to create an open library of 5 second chewing samples for machine learning training based on the "Getting Started with Audio Data Analysis using Deep Learning (with case study)" [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/audio-voice-processing-deep-learning/) and this one on [Noise detection](https://viblo.asia/p/continue-with-machine-learning-noise-detection-classification-L4x5xp6m5BM) 
We shared the [Jupyter notebook created with a help of Simon](chewingtrain/chewingtrain.md)  
Test our piezo based chewing sensors (created by Idiot.io) generating electricity and data to rethink the interaction over chewing: 
- blockchain experiment over Node RED communicating with a Hyperledger contract (chewing on the ledger as pay per chew model)
- generate electricity for LED or device that gives back to the plant you eat or as a way to send an apology.
