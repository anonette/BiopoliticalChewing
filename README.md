# Biopolitical Chewing
We explore chewing as means of biopolitical control in food interaction. 
Join our effort to create an open library of 5 second chewing samples for AI training based on the "Getting Started with Audio Data Analysis using Deep Learning (with case study)" tutorial (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/audio-voice-processing-deep-learning/). 
We shared the Jupyter notebook created with a help of Simon  
Test our piezo based chewing sensors (created by Idiot.io) generating electricity and data to rethink the interaction over chewing: 
- blockchain experiment over Node RED communicating with a Hyperledger contract (chewing on the ledger as pay per chew model)
- generate electricity for LED or device that gives back to the plant you eat or as a way to send an apology.
